# interview_kotlin_coroutine_architecture

Interview Project with Kotlin - Coroutine - MVVM - Hilt - LiveData - Retrofit - Room Architecture 

Introduction
-------------

### Functionality
The app is have one screens.
User inputs a city name and we will show them the weather data for the last 7 days of this city

### Building
You can open the project in Android studio and press run.

### Testing
The project uses UnitTest tests that run on the device
and local unit tests that run on your computer.

##### ViewModel Tests
Each ViewModel is tested using local unit tests with mock Repository
implementations.
##### Repository Tests
Each Repository is tested using local unit tests with mock database.
##### Database Tests
The project creates an in memory database for each database test but still
runs them on the device.
